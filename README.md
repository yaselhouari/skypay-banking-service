# BankingService with TDD

A simple banking service implemented in Java using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

## Overview

This project implements the core functionalities of a banking system:

- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Print transactions

The project is built using **Java 17** and **Maven**, with **JUnit 5** for testing.

## TDD Approach

We follow a strict TDD workflow:

1. Write a failing test
2. Implement just enough code to pass the test
3. Refactor
4. Repeat for the next test
